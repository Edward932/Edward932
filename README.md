### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Professional
I hold an Economics degree from NC State and began my career as a real estate analyst at a private equity firm. After deciding to change careers, I enrolled in App Academy. Post-graduation, I co-founded a startup, developing a mobile app to help podcast listeners catch highlights of their favorite shows without needing to listen to the entire podcast. Currently, I work as a full stack software engineer (contractor) with startup Poppin LLC. I am actively exploring new opportunities in the tech industry.

## Personal
In my free time I am an avid learner and reader. I enjoy reading non-fiction books about business, science, health, and recently computer science and UX/UI design. I also enjoy exercising, being outdoors, and spending time with friends and family.
