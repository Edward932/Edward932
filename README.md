### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Bio
Hi, my name is Edward and I am a full-stack web developer. I have a passion for making fast an intuitive websites. My skills include React.js, React Native, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Redux, Python, Flask, Express, SQLAlchemy, PostgresgresQL, SQLite, AWS, and websockets.

## About me
  Before coming to App Academy I worked as a real estate analyst for a private equity firm. I spent most of my time doing economic research on a variety of topics. I did not mind this job, especially since it was fast paced and I enjoyed working in a team, but there was something missing from my work. I was mostly analyzing and synthesizing data but what I really wanted to do was solve problems and create things so I decided to make a career change and go to App Academy.
	I was not sure what type of coding I wanted to do when I made the leap to go to App Academy, but luckily App Academy spends a lot of time on front-end web development. Over the last six months I have come to the realization that front-end development has everything I am looking for in a job. I love learning and front-end development is always rapidly changing. I also love complex problem solving and design which are both present in front-end development.
  I am excited to start my career as a front-end developer. I am looking forward to solving some challenging problems, thinking from the user's perspective to make intuitive design decisions, and creating tangible products that run fast and users love.
